A plugin for Spigot/Bukkit that adds a flexible magic item system to the game, as well as an API for other developers to create their own spells.

This plugin depends on WbsUtils for the plugin framework, the particle API, and several entity utilities.

The plugin is not currently on Spigot as I don't intend to be active there for bug fixing and updating, but the jar is available under Releases if you want to play with it.
